    <p>Zwetschgendatschi is a classic German plum sheet cake from Bavaria - a short crust pastry, topped with Italian plums. It is traditionally served with vanilla sugar-sweetened whipped cream.</p>

    <h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>

            4 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
            </strong></li>
        <li><strong>

            4 teaspoons baking powder
            </strong></li>
        <li><strong>

            1 cup white sugar
            </strong></li>
        <li><strong>

            2 teaspoons vanilla sugar
            </strong></li>
        <li><strong>

            2 pinches salt
            </strong></li>
        <li><strong>

            1 ⅓ cups unsalted butter, room temperature <br> and cut into chunks
            </strong></li>
        <li><strong>

            2 large eggs
            </strong></li>
        <li><strong>

            2 ¼ pounds Italian prune plums, halved and pitted
            </strong></li>
        <li><strong>

            2 tablespoons white sugar
            </strong></li>
        <li><strong>

            1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
            </strong></li>
        <li><strong>

            2 tablespoons unsalted butter, room <br> temperature and cut into chunks
            </strong></li>
        <li><strong>

            1 tablespoon sliced almonds (Optional)
            </strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h1>STEPS</h1>

    <ol>
        <li> <strong>Combine flour and baking powder in a large bowl. Mix in 1 cup sugar, vanilla <br> sugar, and salt. Add 1 1/3 cups butter and eggs. Knead everything into a smooth <br> dough. Shape dough into a ball, press flat, cover, and chill in the refrigerator 1 <br> hour to overnight.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with <br> butter. </strong></li>
        <li><strong>Cut halved plums in half again, without cutting all the way through, so they fan <br> out. </strong></li>
        <li><strong>Roll pastry dough out on a lightly floured work surface. Line the bottom and <br> sides of the prepared baking sheet with dough. Mix 2 tablespoons sugar and <br> cinnamon together in a bowl. </strong></li>
        <li><strong>Arrange plums side by side on the pastry dough; very small plums should <br> overlap. Dot plums with 2 tablespoons butter and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar <br> and almonds. </strong></li>
        <li><strong>Bake in the preheated oven until pastry crust is lightly browned, 30 to 40 <br> minutes. Remove from oven. Allow plum cake to cool, then cut into squares. <br> Serve lukewarm or at room temperature. </strong></li>
    </ol>
